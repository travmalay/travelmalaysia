                        For its sheer alluring beauty, Redang island is indeed Malaysia’s jewel of the South China Sea. The waters here sparkle with an aquamarine shade, and the sand is invitingly soft in its own pearly whiteness. The diving here is equally impressive with an abundance of marine life that inhabit the beautiful coral reefs as it is located in the protected perimeter of the Terengganu Marine Park.
                        Redang island welcomes thousands of tourists every year, it can get busy, but never too crowded. Accommodation here is largely resort-based and is ideal for groups or family vacations. Although you can find a few private restaurants, most resorts offer full board packages and the occasional BBQs on weekends.

                        Think Terengganu is just famous for its white sandy beaches and gorgeous islands? Not anymore! In case you were living under a rock these past few weeks, Kuala Terengganu has a new drawbridge that connects to Kuala Nerus, and looks like it’s straight out of a fantasy film set. Some even say that it resembles the Tower Bridge in London!.The RM248mil drawbridge, which has yet to be named, can be lifted for ships to pass through, which is also the first of its kind in Southeast Asia. If you’re planning to be among the first ones to drive through it, now is your chance as the drawbridge is now officially opened to the public!.The drawbridge is also a hot spot for wedding photoshoots these days!

                        It’s so popular that the Terengganu’s Mentri Besar Dr Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar had to issue a statement to remind the public to use the parking bays nearby if they want to stop and take pictures, and not park their vehicles on the bridge. Don’t compromise on your safety, as you can enjoy an equally beautiful view of the drawbridge from Pesisir Payang, especially at dusk.

                        With more discoveries by tourists over the years and article coverage about the island, Lang Tengah Island’s beauty is slowly coming into the limelight. In fact, this island that is situated off the coast of Terengganu between Redang Island and Perhentian Island is a hidden gem amongst the popular ones in Malaysia. 

                        With white sandy beaches, clear blue waters, wonderful marine biodiversity, Lang Tengah Island has basically everything that makes up a pretty great island for vacation.

                              <span>How To Get To Lang Tengah Island Malaysia </span><br>
                              If you are travelling from KL, you can either go by car which is a 4 and a half hour ride and have your car parked at Merang Jetty for RM10 per night. You could also take a bus or train to the city of Kuala Terengganu to reach Merang Jetty if you do not mind travelling for about 7 to 8 hours with stopovers. 

                              Alternatively, you could travel by plane on domestic flights to Kuala Terengganu. The Lang Tengah Island resorts usually will provide a land transport service to pick you up from the airport to Merang Jetty.

                              At Merang Jetty, there are ferry or boat transfers to bring you Lang Tengah Island which operates three times per day. Each ride takes between 40 to 45 minutes.

You should not miss the opportunity to dive and snorkel at Pulau Lang Tengah, especially when the island is constantly praised for its beautiful diving and snorkelling sites. You can snorkel on your own just off the beach if you are not up for booking a day’s snorkelling trip.

                          Mix around with schools of parrot fish, baby sharks, blue-ringed angelfish, clown fish and more together with large collections of colourful corals and sea anemones. If you want to have guided snorkelling and diving tours, each Lang Tengah Island resort has a dive centre offering various diving and snorkelling packages plus canoe and kayak rentals if you are up for some boat rowing activities. </p>

                          <span>Blue Tears Tour </span><br><p>This is a popular attraction amongst the tourists on Lang Tengah Island! The term “Blue Tears” refers to the blue-dotted sand along the beaches at night, in which you will be able to witness an incredible view of bioluminescent ostracods that look like shrimps of the size of plankton glowing bright blue on the sand. Most of these creatures use the blue light as a defence mechanism while some use the light to mate.

                          However, the Blue Tears event is not available all the time – this occurrence is subject to weather conditions of the island as unsuitable weather will affect the presence of the ostracods.

                          <span>Jungle Trekking </span><br><p>If you are up for some long walks in the jungle, you could jungle trek to Batu Kuching as it is a great place to capture gorgeous sunrise and sunset from the rocks. Depending on where you stay on the island, travelling to Batu Kuching may take half an hour or more. 

                          There are yellow arrow marks on trees and rocks on the trek to guide you to Batu Kuching. Bring along a torchlight, drinking water and wear proper footwear when jungle trekking. Batu Kuching has a lovely snorkelling site so consider bringing snorkelling gears if you plan to go for a swim.

                          If Batu Kuching is not challenging enough for you, you could also go for a more adventurous trek to Batu Bulan, where you can see fish and turtles when you go snorkelling there. </p>

Such rides are available at Lang Tengah Island resorts – just check with the resort you are staying at for more details on the type of boat ride packages they have to offer. </p>

Turtle Bay is the place where turtle conservation and research efforts are carried out by a team of volunteers called Lang Tengah Turtle Watch (LTTW), and also serves as the main nesting area for turtles.

                          If you happen to visit at a time where the turtles come to the ground, you will be lucky to see nests and maybe even some hatchlings depending on the time of the year!  </p>

                        Located around 25 miles from Kuala Terengganu, Pulau Lang Tengah is a small island known for the untouched tropical jungle. Just like the Redang Island, it has a perfectly clear seawater, as well as white sandy beaches. However, since you can find such things around other islands in the archipelago, the tropical forest is probably the most attractive element. The island itself is quite appealing to travelers who look for quiet and wild getaways. It is one of the quietest islands around. There are not more than just a few resorts on the island, so you are less likely to be disturbed by tourists with cameras around.

                        If you are into diving and snorkeling, you will love the crystal water. Waters are calm, while the local centers also teach diving. On other islands, diving is available to those with experience only. Here, you can actually learn how it is done. Aside from the underwater wildlife, tourists can admire all kinds of lizards, frogs and birds.

                            <span>TRANSPORTATION </span><p>Ferries to both Perhentian islands leave almost every hour from Kuala Besut during regular business hours. Travellers from Kuala Lumpur or other destinations can fly, train, or bus to either Kuala Terengganu or Kota Bharu. From either town, the jetty port in Kuala Besut is accessible by taxi. It is also possible to use minivan services offered by various companies if travelling from Taman Negara, the Cameron Highlands, Kuala Lumpur or many other cities in Malaysia. The minivan services vary in prices and there are many different companies that offer service to and from various destinations. A ferry ride of approximately forty minutes can be arranged by one of the many jetty operators, or in cooperation with many of the resorts. Once on the island, there are limited trails that connect various resorts. A trail on Besar goes through the thick jungle, and some stretches of beach are home to various resorts so visitors can wander freely. The easiest way to travel around the islands is by water taxi, which can be arranged at most resorts.

                          <span>WHEN TO GO </span><p>Due to the eastern monsoon, the season in the Perhentians (and all other east coast islands) is effectively limited to the period between the beginning of February until late October. Outside this period the seas can be very rough and choppy, skies overcast, and with currents that make swimming dangerous and most (though not all) accommodation options are closed. However, many of them located on Coral Bay start on beginning of Feb, while on Long Beach usually a month later. Do not believe the travel-agents when they claim the accommodations are open. Even if they will provide a room, restaurants and all shops (i.e. no place to get water, food, sunscreen etc.) are closed in off-season. If the restaurant is open, food choices will be very limited and over-priced. However, in the village cheap meals and shops are available year-round.When going during off-season be aware that there will be no one there aside from you and maybe a handful of locals.</p>

                        Kapas Island is located nearby the city of Kuala Terengganu at the eastern part of the peninsula. Kapas Island is only 2 kilometers long and 1 kilometer wide. Compared to nearby islands like Perhentian and Redang, Kapas Island is much smaller and therefore less crowded. It is a tiny island that travelers mainly visit for relaxation, sun bathing, diving and especially snorkeling as the corals around Kapas are very nice. You can rent snorkeling equipment for RM10 per day. There are a few paths that you can walk on if you like to do some light jungle trekking.

                            <span>Diving at Kapas Island </span><p>Kapas Island has a few excellent dive sites where you can spot numerous fish species and many sea turtles. There is even a beautiful World War II Japanese ship wreck waiting to be explored. Aqua Sport Divers is the only dive center operating in Kapas Island. If you want to go for your PADI diving license during your visit to Kapas Island it is wise to contact the dive center up front so they can allocate a dive master.

                          <span>Accommodation at Kapas Island </span><p>There are only a few small resorts on the island; most of them offer basic accommodation though some are a bit more luxurious (and offer air-conditioned rooms). There is no Internet access on the island, but some travelers said they had a working 3G connection with their local sim card. Some resorts on the island are found at a remote location. This means you usually stay at your resort for breakfast, lunch and dinner. At the main jetty there are a few local restaurants. You can always ask one of the boatmen at the resort to take you there around dinner time.

                          If you want to stay at a nice place before or after visiting Kapas, then you might want to consider the following three great 5 star resorts; Tanjong Jara Resort (Dungun), Ri-Yaz Heritage Marina Resort (Kuala Terengganu) and the Aryani Resort (Kuala Terengganu).</p>

Some resorts accept credit cards, but it is best to have enough cash with you to cover your expenses while at the island. There is an ATM in Marang and at Kuala Terengganu Airport. There are no shops at Kapas Island, so bring along everything you need from the mainland.</p>

                          <span>How to get to Kapas Island </span><p>TThere are daily flights operated by Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur International Aiport (KLIA & LCCT) to Kuala Terengganu. From here you take a public bus or taxi to the small coastal town of Marang (travel time around 30 minutes). Expect to pay only a few ringgits by bus and around RM30 by taxi. At Marang Jetty the boat to Kapas departs daily from 7am to around 5pm. A return ticket with a fast boat costs RM25. Kapas Island is located only 5km from the coast, so it is only a 15 minute boat ride. When departing from Kapas Island, have your resort staff advise you what time to take the boat to be in time at Kuala Terengganu Airport for your connecting flight. Busses to Kota Bharu or Kuantan depart from the main bus terminal; the Kuala Terengganu Tanjung Bus Terminal.

                        Bidong Island or Pulau Bidong is a tiny island in one square kilometer of width. Located off the Terengganu coast Malaysia, in the South China Sea, the island can be visited from Merang beach town. Bidong Island in Malaysia is a unique destination to choose as it doesn’t offer too beautiful scenery, wonderful BIdong Island sunrise and fun activities to do but it has the interesting history to learn.

                            The first refugee’s group consisting 47 people arrived on the island in 1975. Then in 1978, the other refugees come as many as 121 people. The largest amounts of refugees came in 1979; more than 40,000 people. The sums overloaded the island and the refugee camp was only for about 4,500 people.On October 30, 1991, the island was closed as the refugee camp and it started to rejuvenated. Then in 1999, Bidong Island has opened again but for tourism purpose. The pristine of the island was regained and it started getting many visitors, including the former refugees that were nostalgic with their old home.

                          The travelers only can visit the island with a day trip to see the remnants and learn the history, as well as enjoying the beautiful scenery that has been restored and naturally rejuvenated into the pristine conditions.

                          Besides, the visitors also can enjoy snorkeling, Bidong Island diving, and picnic on the beautiful island’s beach. For the accommodation, you only can get them on Perhentian and Rendang Island.

                          Bidong Island also offers the underwater attraction. It is an underwater gallery in 15 meters of depth that exhibits the replicas of relics and cultural artifacts such as Terengganu Inscription Stone, arch, tepak sireh, and traditional boat.</p>

                        Pulau Gemia is a privately owned island, about 800 metres off Kapas Island. Pulau Gemia has white sandy beaches, crystal clear water, beautiful corals and marine life as some of it’s natural pristine assets.
                        The island is only five kilometres from the east coast of peninsular Malaysia, Gemia Island is easy to miss on a map. It is a tiny, rocky island covered in lush tropical greenery and fringed by curves of pure white sand. While this small gem may easily be overlooked, it will not be easily forgotten.
                        There's only one resort on the privat island named: Gem Wellness Spa & Island Resort.  It's the former Gem Island Resort, they renovated the existing chalets and they refurnished the whole resort. And it got a Spa.

                            <span>WHAT TO DO </span><p>It's situated in a natural lush tropical setting, white sandy beaches interspersed with rock formations, crystal clear waters, spectacular underwater seascape of corals and marine life as some of its natural assets. Visitors could jungle trek around the cleared foot paths to observe and admire the fragile ecosystems at its best.
                            The chalets (Water Villa's)  themselves stand on sturdy concrete stilts, hugging the coastline, with views across the sea offering a perfect holiday escape.You can go snorkelling without taking the boat out. There are many things to see near the shore: corals of different shapes, colours and sizes, sea urchins, swordfishes, butterfly fishes, parrot fishes, bump head fishes, crabs, clams and lots of sea cucumbers. We even saw a clown fish, complete with its ‘house’ of sea anemone.
                            If you hire a boat to take you further out for snorkelling or even scuba diving or deep-sea fishing.There are many interesting little creatures to discover, if you look close enough in the pools of water between the rocks and corals. Hermit crabs, sea snails, oysters, sea anemones (try feeding them) and, of course, more sea cucumbers.
                            If you have no patience for pottering around, visit the baby greenback turtles by the jetty. Pulau Gemia is part of a turtle hatchery programme. Turtle hatchlings are cared for until they’re old and strong enough to survive in the open sea.

                        Tenggol Island is part of a group of islands within the southern regions of the Terengganu Marine Park. Besides Tenggol the group consists of Pulau Nyireh, Tokong Timur, Tokong Burung and Tokong Talang/Tokong Kemudi and Tokong Laut. There are numerous beautiful beaches, and also a few paths that cross the 3 by 2km island; great for some light trekking. Most people visit the Tenggol for its amazing diving possibilities; there are 20 dive sites around the island. Non-divers could enjoy some snorkeling around the island (though Perhentian Island probably is a better choice).

                        "Tenggol Island was cited as “The Best Diving in Peninsular Malaysia” in Asian Diver Magazine Annual Edition."

                            <span>Diving at Tenggol Island </span><p>Most travelers visit Tenggol for its great dive sites. There are quite a few very nice sites, though some are only accessible by advanced (or experienced) divers as most sites are affected by strong currents. Beginners are probably better off at nearby islands like Perhentian, Redang or Tioman. There are three dive operators on the island; Discovery Divers, MrDive Malaysia and Scuba Explorers. Most popular dive spots are; Batu Chanang, Tokong Laut (also known as the Highway), Tokong Burung and Coral Garden. There are sites with some nice wrecks and sites where you can enjoy macro underwater life (especially many nudibranches). Whale sharks are seen at certain sites between August and October every year.

If you stay at one of these resorts, there is no easy way to get out to the other resorts except by boat. Guests usually have their meals at the resort, as there are no public places with restaurants and such on the island. Typical accommodation at these resorts are traditional (style) wooden cabana’s facing the beach.

                          If you want to stay at a nice place before or after visiting Tenggol, then you might want to consider the following three great 5 star resorts; Tanjong Jara Resort (Dungun), Ri-Yaz Heritage Marina Resort (Kuala Terengganu) and the Aryani Resort (Kuala Terengganu). If you stay at Dungun it is also possible to do a day-trip to Tenggol Island.</p>

                          <span>How to get to Tenggol Island </span><p>There are daily flights operated by Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur International Aiport (KLIA & LCCT) to Kuala Terengganu. From here you take a public bus or taxi to the small coastal town of Kuala Dungun (travel time around 1 hour). Expect to pay only a few ringgits by bus and around RM60 by taxi. At Kuala Dungun jetty you can arrange a boat to Tenggol Island. Tenggol Island is located about 25km from the coast, so it is a 50 minute boat ride to reach your resort.

                          Another option is a flight by Firefly from Subang Airport (nearer to KL compared to KLIA/LCCT) to the town of Kerteh. From Kerteh it is only a 20 minute drive by taxi to Kuala Dungun. This option saves a lot of time when you are traveling from Kuala Lumpur.</p>

                        It was a long beach. The sea wave was very good. Good place to see and taking photos during the sunrise and sunset. I loved the stone structures there. Was very enjoyable tour. It is not too popular for the foreigner as most of the visitors was local and the beach location was inside village. There is no public transport available from terengganu bus station to go there as it is inside village you need to take grab to go there and it will cost approximate RM 07-10.

                        If you take the old trunk road from Kuala Terengganu towards Kuantan you will come across a sign that indicates Pantai Kemasik, 10km from the town of Kijal. A distinct natural formation of a set of “twin rocks” sitting at the edge of the water makes this beach one of the most photographed beaches. It has quite an interesting terrain – a vast stretch of sandy beach with an inner lagoon filled only by the sea at high tide. This is one of Terengganu’s most beautiful.

                        Take a stroll with your loved one, run with the kids, fly a kite or have a picnic on the wide sandy beach and immerse yourself in the beautiful scenery around you. Take a moment to appreciate the serenity and perhaps you want to be a bit meditative by just sitting at the waters edge and let the waves wash your worries away. There’s nothing so blissful than watching the blue sky and feeling the breeze on your cheeks. And if you want to climb the rocks, do be careful and make sure you have the right attire for it and take safety precautions.

                        Tasik Kenyir (Lake Kenyir) in Terengganu is the largest man-made lake in the country. According to Tourism Malaysia, it spans 209,199ha. It was formed from 1978 to 1985 by damming the Kenyir River.

                        The dam produces hydro-electric power and helps control flooding in the state.

                        The valleys and plains behind the dam filled up with water and the hilltops and uplands remained to form islands, some 340 of them.

                        River fish soon adapted to their new environment and today this freshwater lake has become a challenging spot for anglers to try their skill.

                        The water level goes up and down according to the seasons – the lake is at its fullest and most beautiful during the March and April wet season. Anglers prefer the dry season around August.

                        Chamerong waterfall is the highest waterfall in Malaysia.This beautiful serene waterfall exhibits the beautiful sights of water gushing down and pounding the rocks at the height of 1214 metres. Huge, uneven boulders are overlapping on one another, making the drizzles flow in between the rocky cracks - creating a splendid view before your eyes. Chemerong Waterfall's magnificent height makes the water looks like it showers down directly from the sky - a majestic view that makes the two-hour trekking a worthwhile experience.

                        Usually, the two-hour hiking to unravel the hidden waterfall is not enough to satisfy advanced hikers' thirst for adventure. Most of the hikers will opt for an adventurous hiking expedition that might take up to three days and two nights. Activities include pitching tents at provided campgrounds, ascending a 200-metre-tall mountain, relaxing at Jeram Lesung Pool, swimming in a 'fish spa', and many more.

                        Adrenaline junkies will get a hit at this experience in Terengganu. The hilltop of Bukit Maras is flat and wide, lending the perfect terrain for paragliders to use as a runway. The best part? You can join in on the fun too!

                        Don’t worry, you won’t need a license of any sort for tandem paragliding as you will be accompanied by an experienced pilot. Aside from a few very simple attractions during take-off and landing, there’s nothing else you’ll need to do except marvel at the sweeping views below (and hang on for dear life!). Everything else – from the steering and controls – will be managed by the pilot harnessed safely to you.We get that some of you may have the jitters just thinking about paragliding. But trust that you’ll be in safe hands all the way through. A 1 hour briefing and preparation will be conducted prior to your flight, by the end of which you will be ready for the full 10 minutes of paragliding.

                        Once you’ve taken that leap of faith: your rewards are majestic views of the surrounding landscape. You will sail over one hill peak to another, sweeping over jungles that lead right up to crystal seas.

                        Around you are the surrounding townships of Bukit Maras. You can bet there will be residents looking up towards you as you streak across the skies!

                            Whatever the case is, you can always opt to prolong your trip with an overnight camp on the summit of Bukit Maras. The site presents a lovely view of the township below, and glittery starry views of the night sky.

                            For an extra RM11, you can also fit in a day or night hike around the surrounding regions of Bukit Maras with an experienced guide.</p>

                        One of Terengganu's newer attractions is the Islamic Civilization Park (Taman Tamadun Islam) featuring scaled-down replicas of 22 famous monuments from the Islamic world.

                        It was opened in 2008 on an island in the Terengganu River just 1.2km from the Terengganu State Museum on the outskirts of Kuala Terengganu city.

                        The park claims to provide 'edutainment' and visitors can learn about the spread of Islamic civilization by marvelling at the detailed replicas of 22 famous mosques and tombs from around the world.
