          <h1>ABOUT SARAWAK</h1>
        <p>
        Sarawak (/səˈrɑːwɒk/; Malay: [saˈrawaʔ]) is a state of Malaysia. The largest among the 13 states, with an area almost equal to that of Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak is located in northwest Borneo Island, and is bordered by the Malaysian state of Sabah to the northeast, Kalimantan (the Indonesian portion of Borneo) to the south, and Brunei in the north. The capital city, Kuching, is the largest city in Sarawak, the economic centre of the state, and the seat of the Sarawak state government. Other cities and towns in Sarawak include Miri, Sibu, and Bintulu. As of the 2015 census, the population of Sarawak was 2,636,000. Sarawak has an equatorial climate with tropical rainforests and abundant animal and plant species. It has several prominent cave systems at Gunung Mulu National Park. Rajang River is the longest river in Malaysia; Bakun Dam, one of the largest dams in Southeast Asia, is located on one of its tributaries, the Balui River. Mount Murud is the highest point in Sarawak.Because of its natural resources, Sarawak specialises in the export of oil and gas, timber and oil palms, but also possesses strong manufacturing, energy and tourism sectors. It is ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse; major ethnic groups including Iban, Malay, Chinese, Melanau, Bidayuh and Orang Ulu. English and Malay are the two official languages of the state; there is no official religion.
        <br><br>
        <span>Weather: </span><p>Sarawak has a tropical geography with an equatorial climate and experiences two monsoon seasons: a northeast monsoon and a southwest monsoon. The northeast monsoon occurs between November and February, bringing heavy rainfall while the southwest monsoon, which occurs between March and October, brings somewhat less rainfall. The climate is stable throughout the year except for the two monsoons, with average daily temperature varying between 23 °C (73 °F) in the morning to 32 °C (90 °F) in the afternoon at coastal areas. Miri has the lowest average temperatures in comparison to other major towns in Sarawak and has the longest daylight hours (more than six hours a day), while other areas receive sunshine for five to six hours a day. Humidity is usually high, exceeding 68 per cent, with annual rainfall varying between 330 centimetres (130 in) and 460 centimetres (180 in) for up to 220 days a year. At highland areas, the temperature can vary from 16 °C (61 °F) to 25 °C (77 °F) during the day and as low as 11 °C (52 °F) during the night</p>

                        The Gunung Mulu National Park is a national park in Miri Division, Sarawak, Malaysia. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that encompasses caves and karst formations in a mountainous equatorial rainforest setting. The park is famous for its caves and the expeditions that have been mounted to explore them and their surrounding rainforest, most notably the Royal Geographical Society Expedition of 1977–1978, which saw over 100 scientists in the field for 15 months. This initiated a series of over 20 expeditions now named the Mulu Caves Project.

                        The national park is named after Mount Mulu, the second highest mountain in Sarawak.</p>

                        A National Park since 1957, Bako offers the perfect introduction to Sarawak’s forests and wildlife.  The park covers the northern tip of the Muara Tebas peninsula, an area of 27 sq km.  Despite its seemingly small size, Bako contains a wide range of vegetation – swamp forest, scrub-like padang vegetation, mangrove forest, dipterocarp forest, delicate cliff vegetation and more.  In fact, at Bako it is possible to see almost every type of vegetation found in Borneo. Bako also contains a rich variety of wildlife and a coastline covered with small bays, coves and beaches.  The park has a number of well-marked trails offering interesting walks ranging from short pleasant strolls to serious full-day hikes.  Unlike some national parks, visitors to Bako are almost guaranteed to see wildlife. Long-tailed macaque monkeys and silver leaf monkeys are ever present, wild boar are often found rummaging around the park HQ, squirrels and monitor lizards are also common. There is every chance of seeing the rare and unusual proboscis monkeys on trails such as Telok Paku and Telok Delima, particularly if you go late afternoon. You are more likely to see wildlife if you quietly follow the trails and keep listening.<br>Bako also has some good white sand beaches that provide perfect resting spots in between jungle treks. Telok Pandan Kecil is perhaps Bako’s best beach. After an hour or so the Telok Pandan Kecil trail comes to a rocky headland. The view down to a beautiful secluded bay, and the thought of a swim in the cool waters, has a magical effect on tired calf muscles. The following 20 minute descent suddenly becomes more enjoyable. All of the beaches are bordered by limestone and sandstone cliffs, and the action of the sea has left some remarkable rock formations, such as the famous Sea Stack.
                        <br>
                        If you take a stroll at sunset on Telok Assam beach near the park HQ, you will see hundreds of swifts hovering around their nests at the rocks at the far end of the beach. Don’t leave the beach after the sun disappears behind Mount Santubong. Wait another 20 minutes as the sky’s colours often change dramatically, providing a colourful backdrop to the mountain.</p>

                        Niah National Park includes palaeolithic & neolithic burial sites, ancient cave paintings and the spectacular cave mouth of the Great Cave, one of the world’s largest cave entrances. The park was gazetted in 1974 and covers 3,183 hectares of rainforest and limestone hills.

                        Whilst Mulu National Park’s cave system is more famous and receives more visitors, Niah Caves has much to offer and is an interesting day trip from Miri.

                        The Great Cave at Niah sheltered human life some 40,000 years ago and this led to a reappraisal of the theories of human distribution on earth. What is even more amazing is there is evidence of continuous humans habitation in this cave until very recently.

                        The park has a visitor information centre, chalet accommodation and a network of plankwalks that allow visitors to explore the forest and enter the caves.</p>

                            <span>The Great Cave </span><br><p>The Great Cave at Niah is truly spectacular both in terms of its enormous size and historical significance. The mouth of the Great Cave is 60 metres high and 250 wide and its floor area covers 10.5 hectares. The cave is accessed from the park HQ by a 3.1 km jungle trail and plankwalk. Archaeological excavations can be see on the left of cave mouth.

                            From the cave mouth a passage leads to a large chamber at the back known as the Padang. Here rock formations are illuminated by shafts of light that the shine though holes in the cave roof. Beyond the Padang is a dark passage called Moon Cave (Gan Kira).

                            The Great Cave has a long history of human settlement. In 1950s and 1960s Niah was the focus of intense archaeological research with excavations led by Tom Harrisson, the curator of the Sarawak Museum, and his wife Barbara.

                            The Harrissons and their team found evidence of long term human occupation and burial. Earthenware, ornaments, bone tools and food remains were found in the caves. Their most notable find was a human skull.

                            The skull was found in 1958 in the West Mouth of the Great Cave. The skull belonged to an adult female. Radiocarbon dating of the charcoal found at the same level of the dig, suggested the skull was 40,000 years old. This made it the oldest modern human fossil known at that time.</p>

Boat shaped coffins or ‘death ships’ were also found at the Painted Cave.

                        Santubong National Park is a great place for a day visit. Santubong is located on the Damai Peninsula, 35km north of Kuching. Seen from sea level, it’s irregular rainforest-covered peaks rise steeply to 810m, forming a catchment for a variety of wildlife. Gunung Santubong provides a spectacular backdrop to hotel resorts, local fishing villages, and the Sarawak Cultural Village. The main popular activities here are hiking to Santubong Summit and swimming at the Waterfall. Its striking peak is visible from Kuching on most days. During your visit, make sure you ask a local about the legend of the Santubong princess!</p>

However, all 4 trails merge at the first View Point. There’s no permit required to climb Santubong and the entire hike shouldn’t take more than 8 hours in total. The climb can be challenging with steep vertical climbs across rope ladders and dense jungle using tree roots as stepping stones.</p>

As all the trails merge after a point, there is really no distinction between each and your choice of trail wholly depends on which parts of the jungle you wish to see and whether you want to make use of the small differences in time and distance. Upto the intersection of the trails, the terrain is not too steep and involves some scenic stretches with river crossings and a waterfall. From there onward there are several rock faces and tall boulders to deal with, which you will need to surmount with the help of ropes and ladders.Most visitors opt to start at one point and descend through one of the others so that you get a greater experience of the forest with its many little surprises in the form of brooks and waterfalls.</p>

The dry season between June and August is the best season to climb Mount Santubong. Try to start the climb as early as you can in the morning so that you can get back to the base before the afternoon thunderstorms that tend to happen throughout the year. Check the local weather conditions before embarking on the trek and be sufficiently prepared with raincoats or ponchos as well as shoes with good grip for the slippery surfaces.</p><span>Climbing safety</span><br><p>Slips and falls:  Though not a very tall mountain, Mount Santubong is not exactly a beginner’s climb with its sheer rock surfaces that require you to climb over rope ladders. There is always the danger of slipping and falling or sustaining minor injuries on this trail. Be sure to have some level of training before embarking on the climb and carry basic medical supplies.</p><span>Permits, Fees, and Regulations</span><p>You don’t need a permit for the trek but you need to register yourself in the visitor’s log at the entry points to the trail, where you’ll be given a registration slip.</p><span>Emergency contacts</span><p>Police & Ambulance: 999,Fire: 994</p>

From Kuching City, it is easy to get a cab or a minivan or bus to Santubong. Some hotels operate tour buses too. It is only 45 minutes to Santubong from Kuching City.</p>

                            <span>Tips for amateur climbers </span><br><p>Though the height of the mountain is not intimidating this is not exactly a beginner’s trek because of the steep boulders that require you to have at least a basic exposure to rock climbing. If you would rather not make the entire trek, opt for the jungle trek circuit that will give you a nice experience of the rainforest and waterfall in the area.<br>

                            In earlier 2019, a climber from Cyprus was lost for a couple of days on Santubong and had to be rescued. So please stick to the trail.</p>

                        Kubah National Park covers 2,230 hectares of mixed dipterocarp forest that is rich in palms, orchids and pitcher plants. The park is dominated by the 911 metre high Mount Serapi, the mountain that provides the stunning backdrop to sunsets over the Kuching Waterfront. The forest at Kubah is mixed dipterocarp, with small areas of scrub forest and isolated patches of kerangas or heath forest.

                        Located just 20 km from Kuching, Kubah National Park is a good day trip destination. There is also a range of accommodation at the park HQ for those interested in an overnight stay. The park’s rainforest scenery is superb and it has a rich variety of orchids and ferns. It is also  famed for its rich diversity of palms, with 93 species found in the park. The park’s jungle streams and waterfalls offer great resting places to cool down after a jungle trek.</p>

                            <span>Jungle Trails </span><br><p>A series of trekking trails allows visitors to experience the park’s attractions. The Palmetum is a short trail (30 mins, one way) devoted to Kubah’s best-known feature – its palms. The Selang Trail (45 mins, one way) ends at a viewing point on Bukit Selang, one of the many hills in the park. The Belian Trail (45 mins, one way) as the name suggests passes a number of Belian or Ironwood trees. Belian is one of the finest hardwoods in Borneo owing to its strength and durability.<br>The Waterfall Trail (90 mins, one way) is one of the most popular and leads to a series of rock pools and waterfall whilst the Rayu Trail (2 hours, one way) connects Kubah to Matang Wildlife Centre.<br>Visitors can also walk along the Summit Road that leads to the top of Mount Serapi. It takes 5-6 hours to walk to the top and back. There is a viewing platform at the summit that offers amazing views of the rainforest, coastline and the wider Kuching area.</p>

Whilst visitors do occasionally see wildlife at Kubah, it is not is as good as Bako National Park for wildlife watching. Kubah is however a good bird watching destination with the paved road from the park HQ to the summit a good spot for early morning birding.<br>

                            In recent years Kubah National Park has gained a reputation as a great place to go frogging. Over 60 species of frogs are found at Kubah, including one of the smallest species of frog in the world.</p>

                        Batang Ai National Park (Malay: Taman Negara Batang Ai) is a national park located in Sri Aman Division, Sarawak, Malaysia. It is located in Lubok Antu, some 250 kilometers east of Kuching. The park covers an area of 24 square kilometres (9.3 sq mi) of extensive tropical rainforest with a number or rare and protected animals surrounding the 24 square kilometer artificial lake created by the Batang Ai hydroelectric reservoir. The park was proclaimed in 1991, and has become increasingly popular with locals and tourists despite the lack of facilities.

                        Access is possible by chartering a boat (traditional boat called Longboat), as water is the main method of transportation in the area. The ride takes approximately about 40 minutes to Batang Ai National Park headquarters. The lush dipterocarp forests are home to the orang-utan, gibbons, and hornbills. The lake creates a beautiful environment and gives a sense of peace and tranquillity. The local inhabitants are mostly Iban, and tours to nearby Iban longhouses are also a tourist diversion. This national park takes strong steps in having the local communities involved in its management. The communities have formed a cooperative called 'Kooperasi Serbaguna Ulu Batang Ai' and are helping to conserve the park.</p>

                            <span>TRAILS </span><br><p>There are five trails in Batang Ai National Park which showcase every aspect of the park’s terrain and vegetation, such as mixed dipterocarp forest, old secondary forest and active shifting cultivations areas, with ancient burial grounds scattered around the area.  Visitors must be accompanied by a registered guide or park ranger at all times.

                            <span>GETTING THERE </span><br><p>Batang Ai National Park is at the headwaters of the Batang Ai and Lubang Baya rivers, some 15km upriver from the Batang Ai Hydro Lake. Access is by motorized traditional longboat from the Aiman Batang Ai Resort jetty or the Batang Ai public jetty. There is no public longboat service and transport should be arranged in advance. The boat journey is roughly 2 hours – 1 hour crossing they hydro lake and another hour ascending the fast-flowing Batang Ai river. At times of low water visitors may have to jump into the crystal clear stream and help to push the boat through small rapids – all part of the fascinating Batang Ai experience.

                            The Batang Ai hydro lake is about 275km (or 5 hours drive) from Kuching. Most visitors arrive as part of an organised tour group where all transport is included. Contact the Visitor’s Information Centre in Kuching for a list of approved tour operators.</p>

                            <span>ACCOMODATION </span><br><p>There is NO visitor accommodation at Batang Ai National Park. Visitors usually stay in one of the nearby Iban longhouses, or at the Aiman Batang Ai Resort and Retreat, which is roughly 1 hour 30 mins by boat from the Park HQ. The park has no canteen facilities, and visitors should bring enough food and drinking water with them.

                            A permit is required for professional photography or filming, which should be arranged in advance with the National Park Booking Office.</p>

                        The Kuching Waterfront, is the most popular gathering place in this capital city. The esplanade stretches for about 900 meter along the south bank of the Sarawak river. Dotted the length of it are food stalls, a restaurant, bistro and street food hawkers.  Many colonial-era buildings seen here have since been re-purposed for modern use. They are the Chinese History Museum, Sarawak Steamship Building and Square Tower. Besides the old, there is a modern amphitheatre that showcases scheduled live entertainment.

                        During the daytime, the Waterfront offers excellent view of the north bank of the river. The Astana (governor’s mansion) and Fort Margherita stand out with their white exterior. The imposing State Assembly Building dominates the skyline. In addition, the Malay kampungs bring up a piece of Sarawak’s heritage that dates back to the rule of the Brooke family.

                        At night, the whole stretch of the esplanade comes alive. Buskers fill the air with ethnic and contemporary songs and music. To add to the vibrancy, the Darul Hana Musical fountain* comes on with its colourful display.</p>

This S-shaped pedestrian suspension bridge opened to the public in November, 2017. The two viewing decks offer excellent 360- panaromic view of the Sarawak River. Up here, one can’t miss the Middle Eastern-inspired Floating Mosque. The mosque is a new landmark of the Kuching Waterfront. To top it all, the sunset experience is mesmerising! Persons on wheel chair will find the walkway to the bridge proper user-friendly.

                            *Two shows from Mondays to Thursdays at 8.30pm-8.45pm and 9.30pm-9.45pm. There are three shows from Fridays to Sundays at 8.30pm-8.45pm, 9.30pm-9.45pm and 10.30pm-10.45pm. Shows may be limited during the Muslim fasting month so do check the timing once you are here.</p>

                            <span>Walking Tour of Kuching Waterfront </span><br><p>he bridge enables one to do a circular walking tour of the north bank and the Waterfront. As a result, you can cross the river either via the bridge first or in one of the charming water taxis and then do a loop back to your starting point. Locals call the water taxis ‘Penambang‘. On this side of the river, you can visit the Brooke Gallery at Fort Margherita. For orchid lovers, the DBKU Orchid Garden has a significant collection of hybrids.

                            As the walk may be long for some, the food court offers a welcome respite whilst enjoying vista of Kuching Vista in it’s entirety. Foodies will want to make a beeline to a kek lapis (layered cake) shop found here. The cake is a Sarawak’s signature food item. Your friends and loved ones may find this gift item…tasteful! Alternatively, buy a loaf or two to serve as energy food when you hit the trails of one of our many national parks.</p>

                        It’s a sad as the iconic rock formation of Tusan Beach is reported to have collapsed.

                        Tusan Beach is a well-known tourist attraction roughly 30 minutes away from Miri, Sarawak. The cliffs in Tanjung Layang-Layang arches into the sea like a horse drinking water. Hence it was fondly dubbed the “Horse Head Drinking Water”.But The beach is also famous for its ‘Blue Tears’, a natural phenomenon in which bio luminescent plankton glow in brilliant blue. It was only in 2015 that the first sighting of the ‘Blue Tears’ and the ‘Horse Head’ were discovered and propelled Tusan Beach to fame.

                        There is a great view of the open sea, and the sunsets here are phenomenal. Many come here for photography sessions.

                        According to the Borneo Post, the incident happened on Thursday after a heavy rain.
                        <br>
                        “22.2.2020 is a very sad day for Miri, one of the jewels of Miri’s tourist attractions is gone, the ‘horse drinking water’ feature at Tusan Beach was reported to have collapsed,” said Sarawak Minister of Transport Datuk Lee Kim Shin.

                        Authorities are investigating the cause of the incident.</p>

                        The Talang Satang National Park is a national park in Kuching Division, Sarawak, Malaysia. It is Sarawak's first marine protected area, and covers the four islands Pulau Talang-Talang Besar, Pulau Talang-Talang Kecil, Pulau Satang Besar and Pulau Satang Kecil and surrounding coral reefs.<br>

                        The park was established to protect marine turtles; four species of marine turtles are known to nest in the park, including green turtles and hawksbill turtles.<br>
                        Owing to their small size and fragile environment, the Talang Talang Islands have not been developed for tourism. Instead the government’s emphasis has been on turtle conservation.Sarawak is a pioneer of turtle conservation with Talang Talang being the first site in the world to be the focus of turtle research and management activities. The now common turtle conservation strategies of tagging adult turtles and relocating eggs to hatcheries were first tried out on the tiny islands of Talang Talang.Conservation work continues today. Park rangers monitor the beaches, record turtle landings, nests, number of eggs and hatchlings. There are turtle hatcheries on both of the islands. The largest hatchery is on Pulau Talang Besar.
                        <br>
                        Whilst turtles land on the island’s beaches throughout the year, the main turtle nesting season is from April to October.  June, July and August are the busiest months with 10-20 turtle landings per night.  2,000-2,500 nests and 150,000-200,000 eggs are recorded on Pulau Talang Besar each year.  On average 65% of eggs hatch.</p>

There is no regular boat service and visitors should travel in an organised tour. A number of Kuching-based tour operators run day trips to the island, often in conjunction with other marine-based activities such as dolphin watching or mangrove cruises. All other areas of Talang-Satang National Park are off limits to visitors except by special arrangement, in which case transport will be organised by Sarawak Forestry.
