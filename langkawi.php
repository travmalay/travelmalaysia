      <h1>ABOUT LANGKAWI</h1>
        <span>ETYMOLOGY: </span><p>
        There are many suggestions for the origin of the name of Langkawi. According to one interpretation, Langkawi means island of the reddish-brown eagle, a Brahminy kite in colloquial Malay. The Malay word for eagle is helang (shortened to lang), and kawi is a red stone used as a chalk to mark goods. This interpretation was used to create the landmark sculpture of an eagle as the symbol of Langkawi at Dataran Helang (Eagle Square) in Kuah<br>
        <span>Weather: </span><p>Langkawi receives more than 2,400 mm (94 in) of rain annually. Langkawi features a Tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification (Aw) ) Langkawi has a true dry season from December until February. March to November is a long rainy season. September is the wettest month, when it normally receives more than 500 mm (20 in).</p>

        <span>TOURISM: </span><p>On 1 June 2007, Langkawi Island was given a World Geopark status by UNESCO.Three of its main conservation areas in Langkawi Geopark are Machincang Cambrian Geoforest Park, Kilim Karst Geoforest Park, and Dayang Bunting Marble Geoforest park (Island of the Pregnant Maiden Lake). These three parks are the most popular tourism area within Langkawi Geopark. In 2014, UNESCO issued a "yellow card" warning threatening the status of the Geopark</p>
        </p>

        <span>HOW TO ENTER INTO THE ISLAND: </span><p>Tourists can enter the island via ferry from Kuala Kedah, Kuala Perlis, and Penang. Or by domestic flight from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL) via Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia, Malindo Air, or Subang Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport (SZB) via Malindo Air and Fireflyz providing budget connection to the island.

                        The best way to see the beauty of Langkawi is when you’re 708m above sea level! Climb aboard the highest cable car ride in Malaysia and embark on a journey through the eastern cliffs of Mt. Machinchang and its summit. From the Base Station to the Middle Station, SkyCab will take you on a scenic ride 650m above sea level, covering over1,700m in distance. And once you reach the station, you’ll alight and make a short walk up the stairs to reach the Top Station where you’ll be pleasantly rewarded by spectacular views of the entire Langkawi archipelago and Southern Thailand. Have the option to choose a standard designed gondola or level up your sightseeing experience with a glass bottom gondola. If you are not a fan of waiting in long lines, you can take the convenient route and book the Express Lane or VIP Gondola ticket offer. Don't forget to check out the attractions at the station like SkyTrail, 3D Art Langkawi, SkyRex, and SkyDome - access is included in all packages, afterall!

                        <p class="para">
                        Known locally as Telaga Tujuh, Seven Wells Waterfall is so named because seven natural pools have been formed at different levels by water streams that flow down the second highest mountain of Langkawi - Mount Mat Cincang. This is the most picturesque and undoubtedly the best waterfall in the island. 
 
 
 
                          The total vertical fall is 91 meters and the lowest pool is formed at the bottom. Seven Wells Waterfall is located in Pantai Kok area and close to the Pantai Kok Beach and Oriental Village where the Cable Car ride takes place. 
                          
                          You need to hike from the car park. There are two ways of watching the waterfall. If you are not too keen climbing and tiring yourself and like to take a quick look of the vertical waterfall, then take a short walk up the service road that leads from the car park and take the left turn to reach the bottom of the falls. You will get great view of the fall from here. If you want, you can even bathe at the natural shallow pool here. 
                          
                          But the real fun is when you reach up to the top of the fall. And nothing comes easy. You can either continue along the steep service road (this time take the right instead) or take the stairs from the car park (behind the stalls) that goes all the way up to the top. There are 638 steps to climb and the total altitude at which you will finally reach the top of the waterfall is about 480 meters. There are signs on the way showing how many steps are remaining and height to climb further. So if you are going to the top, take easy and slow steps. The pathway goes through the rainforest of Mount Mat Cincang where you will hopefully see lots of flora and fauna including bird life. 
                        </p>

                        <span>PRECAUTION: </span><br><p>
                        There are few things to be careful about while at top of Seven Wells Waterfall. Do not stand on the edge of a rock. They can get very slippery at times and you may have a bad fall. The rocks at the bottom of the pools are also quite slippery, so take care while plunging into the pool or getting out of it. Second, do not go beyond the barricade area on top that has prominent warning signs. It is dangerous to go there as several fatal accidents have taken place there. The drop from there is 65 meters into the waterfall and there won't be any chance of survival.

                            While I have noticed that pools here always have enough water for bathing, in order to enjoy the waterfall in its full flow, the monsoon season (September - October) would be the best time to visit. But that time, even the stairs to climb could be quite mossy and slippery. There is a resting place (a gazebo like structure) on top. However there is no changing room for swimmers. I didn't find the toilet in good condition either.

                        Entry is free and you can visit Seven Wells Waterfall anytime during the day time.</p>

                        There are several shops near the car park at the bottom. Some of them sell fresh coconut water, quite refreshing after the hike. You will also get souvenirs, snacks and even ice creams at the stalls. Two and four wheeler paid parking is available (Car RM2 and Motor Bikes RM1). 
 
                        There is a visitors center at the base. You can also take a guide for the hike if you so want. But they may not be always available.

                        <span>Location & How to Reach </span><br><p>
                        Seven Wells Waterfall is further 2km north of Pantai Kok Beach. Once past Pantai Kok Beach (along the road Jalan Teluk Yu), take a right turn (into Jalan Teluk Tujuh) away from the Burau Bay beach. You will reach the Car Park in about 1km. It is about 27kms from Kuah Town. 
 
                        Although you can come here easily by a taxi, getting a taxi here for your return may be difficult. So come here either by a rental car or hire a taxi by the hour and keep the taxi waiting. There is no bus service to Seven Wells.

                        Located on the north eastern corner of Langkawi, Tanjung Rhu derives its name from the tall casuarina trees that line its shore. The word ‘Tanjung’ in Malay means a cape and ‘Rhu’ stands for Casuarina tree. This secluded beach has blue waters of the Andaman Sea, ivory white sand, and a mild, cool breeze. Tanjung Rhu has shallow waters for easy swimming, snorkelling or kayaking to explore the marine life of Langkawi. It is also a popular spot to watch the sunset, as dusk here is a display of vibrant shades of pink, orange, yellow and grey.

 

                        During low tide, it is even possible to walk across the sea, to the nearest island of Pulau Chabang. The beach is frequented by families, couples and those seeking solitude away from the hustle and bustle of the main island.

                        

                        From the beach jetty, you can go on a boat tour to Kilim Geopark and Mangrove forests. Motor boats are also available for hire to visit the nearby islands with ancient limestone formations. Gua Cherita the caves of legend, can also be accessed from here. Although, Tanjung Rhu is a public beach, there are no toilets or changing rooms available, and only 450 meters of the beach is open to the public. The rest of the beach is shared by two luxury resorts the Tanjung Rhu resort and the Four Seasons. For a snack or a drink, it is best to bring your own or head to one of the restaurants inside the resorts.

                            Tanjung Rhu beach can be accessed from a road named Jalan Tanjung Rhu which is near the village Padang Lalan. Once on the coastal road, a diversion leads visitors all the way to the entrance of the beach. The coastal road runs along with famous hotels situated on both sides such as Tanjung Rhu resort.

                            Soon comes a point where the coastal road meets the sand that marks the public area of Tanjung Rhu beach. The beach is at a distance of about 22 kilometres from Kuah Town and can be reached by a hired taxi. The fare of the taxi ride costs approximately RM40 from Kuah. Similarly, tourists may also rent cars for self-driving.

                        The months of January to March are considered to be the peak tourist season in Tanjung Rhu. During these months, the region experiences no rainfall and the temperature rises as high as 35 degrees, marking a dry spell in Tanjung Rhu.

                        The following months of April to August, also known as the midseason witness occasional rainfalls with cloudy skies and short-lived thunderstorms. The temperature remains below 30 degrees post afternoon. The low season of September to October is the rainy season which brings about 2 hours of rainfall on average each day; but enough dry time in the rest of the hours.

                        Thus, for tourists who do not mind peak crowds, January to March is the best time to visit Tanjung Rhu Beach. During this season, the beach hosts several festivals and celebrations; plus the weather is suitable for beach activities like boating and snorkelling. Whereas, for tourists who would like to spend time in solitude, September to October is a good time to visit Tanjung Rhu beach as the region meets less number of tourists from around the world.

                        Pulau Payar Marine Park is a popular site for snorkelling and diving enthusiasts keen on exploring Langkawi’s undersea action. Just 30km south of the main island, it is about 45 minutes away from the Kuah jetty point and you can take either a catamaran or a speedboat to get here.

                        Comprising four islands, the largest of which is Pulau Payar, and three smaller isles (Pulau Kaca, Pulau Lembu and Pulau Segantang) this marine park is spread over two nautical miles. None of these islands are inhabited and are strictly regulated by the Fisheries Department of Kedah to maintain their pristine condition.
                        One of Pulau Payar Marine Park’s best features is its Coral Garden, a secluded section of the ‘park’ with colourful coral beautifully protected and preserved due to its sheltered waters. Those eager to explore the park will have to obtain permission from the authorities (fishing is strictly prohibited) before venturing into the waters: alternatively you can join a tour group.

                        The park caters well to tourists with an extensive array of facilities ranging from picnic tables, barbecue pits, gazebos and restrooms set at strategic points throughout the park.
