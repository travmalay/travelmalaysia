                          <span>Essentials </span><p>A good vacation is never without some must-have essentials. As Kinabalu Park is located in a hilly area, it is best to pack up warm clothing and gloves to ward off the cold. Also, don’t forget to bring a highly water resistant knapsack and a raincoat in case it rains.

                          The rough terrains of Mount Kinabalu require its ambitious to-be conquerors to have comfortable walking/ tracking shoes with them. Last but not least, be well prepared with energy snacks e.g. chocolate, nuts, glucose sweets and a water bottle for fuel and hydration. As a safety recommendation, bring along a torch light in case one gets lost at night.</p>

                        Mabul is also renowned for its amazing array of macrolife, making it an underwater photographer’s dream location to capture some of the rarest ecological species on film. Flamboyant cuttlefish, blue-ringed octopus, spike-fin gobies, frogfish and moray eels are just some of the spectacular critters you will encounter beneath the waters of Mabul.

                        The island is a small oval shaped island fringed by sandy beaches and perched on the northwest corner of a larger 200-hectare reef. The reef is on the edge of the continental shelf and the seabed surrounding the reef slopes out to 25–30m deep. In addition, Mabul is also a local island-village. Accommodation ranges from backpacker styled lodges to water bungalows.

                        Although all the excitement is underwater, you can always set your scuba gear aside for a day to laze on Mabul’s soft sand to work on your tan. It is about a 45 minute boat ride from the Semporna town jetty.

                        Within a short distance and prominently visible from the island is the Seaventures Dive Rig. The rig was previously used in the oil and gas industry and was decommissioned in 1985 and stationed in Singapore. It was move to Mabul in 1997 and besides housing travelers, the six legs of the rig shelters marine life.

                          Mabul is arguably one of the richest single destinations for exotic small marine life anywhere in the world.[citation needed] Flamboyant cuttlefish, blue-ringed octopus, mimic octopus and bobtail squids are just a few of the numerous types of cephalopods to be found on Mabul's reef. Many types of gobies can be found including the spike-fin goby, black sail-fin goby and metallic shrimp goby. Frogfish are everywhere; giant, painted and clown frogfish are regularly seen along with most of the scorpion fish family.

                          There are six resorts here providing accommodation for scuba divers—most located on the island or on stilts over the water, while one is on a converted oil platform about 500 metres from the beach. There are also several homestay & backpacker accommodations which can arrange diving. All of the resorts/homestays can arrange a day trip to the nearby island of Pulau Sipadan. There is a permit system for Sipadan and all permits may be booked months in advance.</p>

                        The centre opened in 1964 as the first official orangutan rehabilitation project for rescued orphaned baby orangutans from logging sites, plantations, illegal hunting or kept as pets. The orphaned orangutans are trained to survive again in the wild and are released as soon as they are ready. The centre has however attracted criticism for its tourism activities and rehabilitation efficacy.The sanctuary is located within the Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve which covers an area of 4,294 ha (10,610 acres), much of which is virgin rainforest.Today around 60 to 80 orangutans are living free in the reserve.It has become one of Sabah's tourist attractions.
                        <br>
                        In October 2014 the centre opened a new section where visitors can view the nursery area where the younger Orangutans first learn to be outside and play on a large climbing frame. This consists of 2 large indoor seating areas (one with air conditioning and one with fans only) with a large window that overlooks the play area. There is no additional charge to enter this part of the centre.

                        The Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre is neighboured to the <a href="https://www.bsbcc.org.my/index.html">Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre</a> and shares veterinary facilities, personnel, parking, access roads and ticket gates.

                        About 80km from Lahad Datu city is the Danum Valley Conservation Area, considered as one of the world’s most complex ecosystem and classified at Class 1 (Protection) Forest Reserve under the Sabah Forestry Enactment 1968. The enchanted forest serves as a natural home for the unimaginable number of plants and wildlife species such as banteng, clouded leopard, orang utan, slow loris, proboscis monkey including the endangered Bornean pygmy elephant.
                        <br>
                        The Danum Valley Field Centre (DVFC) is among the top tropical biodiversity research centre in the world. DVFC is a testament for the long-standing partnership established since 1984, between The Royal Society of United Kingdom’s South East Asia Rainforest Research Programme (SEARRP) and Danum Valley Management Committee. Previously reserve for researchers only, the facilities are now extended to visitors looking for  a basic stay while exploring Danum Valley.

                        Pulau Tiga, literally means 'three islands' in Malay, is surrounded by the pristine South China Sea. Although Pulau Tiga no longer dabbles in show business, its name is no stranger to travellers from all walks of life who enjoy a weekend getaway in the isolated bliss Pulau Tiga has to offer. Picturesque sceneries of the vast ocean, white sandy beaches to sink your toes in, and a therapeutic soak in the mud pools will be a sure way to ease away tension and churn out a couple of laughs within your party. If you are seeking adventure, you can also opt for a short hike in the jungle, visit the nearby snake island for some wildlife sightings or camp in the wildness!

                          If one wants to plan their visit in a time when they can avoid the flock of tourists, autumn months are also a good option. The months of September to November are an off tourist season and cheap accommodations can also be found during this time. One can even face light showers of rain during these months.<br>

                          Summer months are also open to visitors but the cache lies in the sudden worsening of weather conditions here. Almost no tourists can be seen visiting the beach in May due to the scorching heat. Heavy rainfall can hinder the experience of exploring the pristine location.<br>

During this time the price hikes for everything starting from accommodations at the hotels to the flight fares.

                        Nature explorers will simply love the Maliau Basin as it is an excellent site for jungle trekking and bird watching. It contains an unusual assemblage of 12 forest types, comprising mainly of lower montane forest dominated by majestic Agathis trees, rare montane heath forest and lowland, and hill dipterocarp forest. The highlight of the adventure is to trek the majestic 7 tiers Maliau Falls.The diverse ecosystem makes an excellent jungle experience. At night, visitors may also take a night drive for wildlife spotting. Water babies can also take a dip in the beautiful waterfall.

                          <span>GETTING THERE </span><p>The nearest major towns with airports are Kota Kinabalu or Tawau. Driving from these locations will take around 6 and 4 hours respectively with road conditions being poor in sections. If you are leaving from Kota Kinabalu you will first make your way to the rural town of Keningau before continuing to the Maliau Basin Study Centre. Unfortunately there is not quick way to get to Maliau Basin by road, however venturing this far into Borneo’s interior will really make you feel like you are stepping off the map.</p>

                        The beauty of Sabah’s islands is legendary. But while diving hotspots like Sipadan are having their moment, the archipelago has many other lesser-known islands such as the stunning Bohey Dulang

                        The glittering archipelago of Semporna is home to pristine, palm-lined islands – one of which is Bohey Dulang. Formed by the remnants of an ancient volcano, this mountainous landmass is the second-largest in Tun Sakaran Marine Park. Though an overnight stay on the island isn’t possible, it’s a popular day trip for birdwatching enthusiasts, trekkers and divers. But what truly sets it apart from other Bornean islands is the majestic view of archipelago from its highest peak – that view alone draws tourists year-round.

                        Polumpung Melangkap View Camp Site in Kota Belud, Sabah, is the best place to chill out, enjoy nature and of course, take pictures, among others.The camp site is fairly new – it was “formed” as a direct result of the devastating Sabah earthquake in 2015 (and subsequent floods a few months later), when geographical changes took place in the village. The villagers then took the opportunity to promote Kampung Melangkap as a rural tourist attraction, offering activities like camping and river rafting.

                        Polumpung is just one of a handful of camp sites you can visit at the village, but it is also the most accessible and affordable. It also offers the best view of the mountain.

                        The river that runs through the village is clean and its water is always cool, even on hot sunny days. This is because the water comes straight from the mountain.

                        If the river’s current gets a little too strong for you, just head to the man-made pool for a quick dip.

                        At night, enjoy the view of a million twinkling stars in the dark sky.

                        Yes, it will be really dark so do bring along a torchlight or two.

Otherwise, just order some food from their cafeteria.<br>Toilets, showers and changing rooms are also available, but do bring your own toiletries and towels.<br>Polumpung Melangkap has various facilities such as a grocery store, prayer rooms, washrooms, changing rooms and showers.

                        Mount Trusmadi is located about 70 kilometres southeast of Kota Kinabalu City; its forest reserve covers an area of 184,527 hectares bordering four districts – Ranau up north, Tambunan on the west, Keningau down south and Sook in the east.

                        Standing at 2, 642 meters (8, 668 feet) tall, Mount Trus Madi is the second highest mountain in Sabah and Malaysia after Mount Kinabalu. However, it is said to offer a tougher challenge to its climbers compared to Mount Kinabalu.

                        Pulau Bodgaya, Pulau Bohey Dulang and Pulau Tetagan together form a semi-circular group of islands marking part of the rim of a large, ancient volcanic crater.

                        Approximately 8km long and 1.5km wide, Bodgaya Island covers an area of ~796.4 hectares, making it the largest of the 8 islands in Tun Sakaran Marine Park.

                        There are no coral sand beaches here, as there are on nearby islands. Beaches on Pulau Bodgaya are formed mainly from cobbles of volcanic rocks believed to be of late Tertiary (Pliocene) and Quaternary origin (up to 2.58 million years ago).

                        There’s an abundance of flora and fauna in the sheltered slopes and valleys of the island, where the richest vegetation and tallest trees in the area may be found. A number of freshwater streams flow along its northern end.

                        Famed for its beauty even before Sipadan was discovered, Pulau Sibuan is a tear-shaped sand cay situated about 30 minutes from Semporna.
                        Sibuan Island (Local Name: Pulau Sibuan) is also known as Battleship Island (军舰岛 in Chinese) because of its long and narrow shape. Its “bow” is the long strip of white sandy beach pointing to the north, and the dense trees behind looks like the bridge of a ship. Covering an area of approximately 15.13 hectares (0.15 square Kilometre), Sibuan is a sand cays island built entirely from the eroded remains of coral reef.
                        Located next to Church Reef, it is known as one of the most picturesque islands in Tun Sakaran Marine Park, due to its largely untouched conditions.

                        Whether you choose to come here for snorkeling, diving or a picnic, you’ll find that Sibuan Island is truly hard to beat as far as beauty and underwater splendor is concerned.

                          Pulau Sibuan’s crystal clear waters are a sight for sore eyes in any beachgoer’s book, making it truly a snorkeling haven that is second to none.

                          Several dive operators organize their PADI Open Water diving courses here, including Scuba Junkie and Sipadan Scuba.<br>

                          <span>Lunch picnics</span><br>
                          The large sandbank over here is a favourite spot for lunchtime picnics.

                          There is a small, friendly community of Bajau Laut living in and around Pulau Sibuan.Sea Bajau are naturally born with a special ability because they have a body part bigger than ours (Want to guess what it is?). They can free dive up to a depth of 200 feet and hold their breath for 13 minutes. They are sea people for centuries, so their spleen evolved to be 50% bigger, to supply more oxygen. They are becoming a mermaid!</p>

                          <span>GETTING THERE </span><p>To visit Sibuan Island, first fly to Kuala Lumpur or Kota Kinabalu city (capital of Malaysia and Sabah State respectively), then take a direct flight from these cities to Tawau City in East Coast of Sabah by AirAsia or Malaysia Airlines. Then get a taxi from Tawau airport to go to Semporna town, which takes about an hour. From Semporna town, the boat to Sibuan Island takes around 30 minutes.Sibuan is located ±30 minutes by boat from Semporna, ±25 minutes from Pom Pom, ±35 minutes from Mataking and ±1.5 hours from Mabul.

And flying drone is prohibited on Sibuan (and many islands in Semporna).Be informed that other than a small and smelly toilet in the center of Sibuan, there is no restaurant and other amenities in Sibuan. Bring your food and water if you want to spend long hours on this island (usually travel agent will prepare for you).

                        Mantabuan Island is the smallest island in Tun Sakaran Marine Park, with an area of ~10 hectares or 0.1km².

                        It is located just ±2km from the northern coasts of Bohey Dulang and Bodgaya, the biggest island in the marine park.Mantabuan is a volcanically formed and mostly submerged island that is paradise for divers who want to see magnificent coral and with unsurpassed visibility. It is also one of the best islands in the area for manta rays, and devil rays can often be found in the blue as well. The Black Coral Garden, this rare and precious coral can be found in just 22 meter of waters. In addition to the black coral, pristine soft coral and large table coral can be found throughout the entirety of the island. Huge coral boulders in the shallow provide shelter to a large number of marine lives, including myriad nudibranches, painted lobster, blue-spotted ribbon rays, and thousand upon thousand of reef fish. Dive sites further to the north and west of the island on the other hand are great to look for turtles, barracudas and a wide variety of smaller critters.

                        Pulau Mantabuan is inhabited by a small, friendly community of Sea Gypsies (Bajau Laut), who live in houseboats or stilt houses built over coral reefs. Over here, it is not uncommon for visitors to be invited into their homes for a fresh coconut or two.

                        The Malaysian army operates a military base on the island, and if you’re lucky, you may get the chance to snap a photo inside the army outpost that comes complete with artillery and sandbags.

                        There are no motor vehicles or fancy commercial developments here, and visitors to the island are far and few in between.

                          Pulau Mantabuan is a hot spot for snorkeling and diving activities. Featuring 3 major dive sites, Black Coral Garden, Stingray Alley Way and Star Point, Mantabuan is best known for sighting groups of manta rays, eagle rays and devil rays, especially when the currents pick up.

                          Other marine life commonly found in the area include sea turtles, blue-spotted stingrays, crocodile fish, puffer fish and the rare black coral.<br>

                          There is a small, friendly community of Bajau Laut living in and around Pulau Sibuan.Sea Bajau are naturally born with a special ability because they have a body part bigger than ours (Want to guess what it is?). They can free dive up to a depth of 200 feet and hold their breath for 13 minutes. They are sea people for centuries, so their spleen evolved to be 50% bigger, to supply more oxygen. They are becoming a mermaid!</p>
